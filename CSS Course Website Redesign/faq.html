				        <h3>Q: Is this site the official site for the course?</h3>
    	   				<p>
    	   					No, Blackboard is the official site, you will be uploading your assignments 
    	   					there.
						</p>

				        <h3>Q: What if there is a descrepency between assignment files on this site and 
				        	blackboard?</h3>
    	   				<p>
    	   					I've made every attempt to make sure the files on blackboard and this site 
    	   					are the same however if you find any descrepencies, the files on blackboard 
    	   					are the official files.  Also, if you find a file that is different, would 
    	   					you please send me a note to let me know, I'd greatly appreciate it!
						</p>

				        <h3>Q: What Software is Required for this Course?</h3>
    	   				<p>
							While you could build HTML web pages using nothing more than NotePad (PC) or
							TextEdit (Mac), it is highly recommended to use a Web Development IDE like 
							Aptana Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.
						</p>

				        <h3>Q: How will we be testing on different devices for responsive web design?</h3>
						<p>	
							You will be testing your pages during the development process using a 
							pretty cool extension for the Google Chrome Web Browser called Ripple. It will 
							allow you to see what your pages will look like on several different devices 
							and screen sizes including iPhones, iPads, Android Devices, Blackberry and many 
							more.
						</p>
						
				        <h3>Q: The final project looks interesting, was that your idea?</h3>
						<p>	
							I wish I could say it was but the original concept is that of a very good 
							instructor named Professor DeDonno at Saddleback College.
