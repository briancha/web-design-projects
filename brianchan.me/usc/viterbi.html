<p>The Viterbi School of Engineering (formerly the USC School of Engineering) is located at the University of Southern California in the United States. It was renamed following a $52 million donation by Andrew Viterbi. The USC Viterbi School of Engineering celebrated its 100th birthday in conjunction with the university&rsquo;s 125th birthday.</p>
<p>With over $135 million in external funding support, the school is among the nation&rsquo;s highest in volume of research activity. The Viterbi School of Engineering is currently ranked No. 9 nationally by U.S. News and World Report.</p>
<p>The school is headed by Dean Yannis Yortsos. Its research centers have played a major role in development of multiple technologies, including early development of the Internet when USC researcher Jonathan Postel was an editor of communications-protocol for the fledgling internet, also known as ARPANET. The school&rsquo;s faculty includes Irving Reed, Leonard Adleman, Solomon W. Golomb, Barry Boehm, Clifford Newman, Richard Bellman, Lloyd Welch, Alexander Sawchuk, and George V. Chilingar.</p>
