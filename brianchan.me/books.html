                <p>Every time I am in a social situation, whether meeting someone for the first time or talking to a lifelong friend, I use principles from this book. The principles are so simple&mdash;listen, remember people's names&mdash;but so difficult to train yourself to implement.</p>

				<p>Too often we spend so much time talking about ourselves that we completely ignore others' need to express their opinions and feel important.</p>

				<p>I truly believe that internalizing the principles of this book will give you the equivalent of ten years of social experience.</p>

					<h3><strong>Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me)</strong></h3>
				</a>
                <p>Often, we look at criminals, dictators, and disgraced politicians, and think, "How do they live with themselves?" The answer lies in the human ability of self-justification. As humans, we are capable of justifying nearly any action, as long as it happens one small step at a time. We convince ourselves of our own goodness by altering our memories, blaming others, and insisting on being right. Once we form an opinion, it is very hard for us to change it. This causes small errors to turn into lifelong mistakes. Insightful read.</p>

					Through narratives about two people, David Brooks contrasts life as a child growing up in the middle class compared with the poor. Throughout, Brooks includes several interesting facts, for example:
					<ul>
						<li>Marital satisfaction follows U-shaped curve: highest in the first few years, declines and bottoms out when children are teens, and climbs back up in retirement</li>
						<li>Babies are cute so their mothers will take care of them</li>
						<li>Self-control is 2x as important as IQ in predicting high school performance, school attendance, and final grades.</li>

					I specifically recommend the essay by Peter Lynch: <em>Stalking the Tenbagger</em> (a chapter from his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/One-Up-On-Wall-Street/dp/0743200403">One Up On Wall Street</a>). It completely changed my thinking and the way I approach investing.
					<ul>
						<li>Summary: Invest in what you know: companies that you interact with on a daily basis (work for, buy from, or sell to). You have an "inside" advantage on these companies because you know more about them than the average Wall Street analyst does. You can see trends up to a year ahead of financial analysts.</li>
						<li>After reading this, I added a rule to my investing checklist: do I buy from, work for, or sell to this company in my daily life?</li>

				<p>What I love most about this book is that Clay applies the business theories he has worked on throughout his career to people's personal lives, giving business examples of his concepts along the way.</p>
				<p>Too often, ambitious people invest their time and energy into their careers, to the detriment of their families and relationships. They don't often realize this until the end of their lives, when they have estranged families and few close relationships.</p>
				<p>The moral of the story: be as deliberate with your life as you would be with your career or company.</p>
				<p>Clay's TED talk captures the main points of the book:</p>
