<p>The USC Marshall School of Business is a private research and academic institution at the University of Southern California. It is the largest of USC's 17 professional schools. The current Dean is James G. Ellis. In 1997, the school was renamed following a US$35 million donation from alumnus Gordon S. Marshall.</p>
<p>Consistently ranked among the nation's premier schools, USC Marshall is internationally recognized for its emphasis on entrepreneurship and innovation, social responsibility and path-breaking research. Located in the heart of Los Angeles, one of the world's leading business centers and the U.S. gateway to the Pacific Rim, Marshall offers its 5,700-plus undergraduate and graduate students a unique world view and impressive global experiential opportunities. With an alumni community spanning 123 countries, USC Marshall students join a worldwide community of thought leaders who are redefining the way business works.</p>
<p>The Marshall School offers a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. There are several joint programs that offer studies with International Relations and Cinematic Arts in combination with Business Administration. New students take a business core and have other time to fulfill the USC Core and take elective classes. Until the 2010â€“2011 academic year, each student chose a concentration to complete with the degree. It also offers an undergraduate Bachelor Science in Accounting degree through the Leventhal School.</p>
